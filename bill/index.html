        If the suit is by a noncitizen, such as a corporation, directed towards a private citizen, then the private citizen is exempt from needing to pay the corporation's lawyers' fees.

        A suit between two corporations is to be treated the same as a suit between two private citizens, that is, the loser must pay all lawyers' fees.<br/>

        <h3>Section 4</h3> All laws or parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.<br/>
        <h3>Section 5</h3> This act shall become effective 30 days after approval by the Governor or its otherwise becoming a law.<br/>
        <h3>Section 6</h3> Upon approval by the Governor, this bill will be reviewed by the Appropriation Committee for funding.
